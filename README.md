# Orion's Revenge: Open Edition
This is a game I created back in 2012 for Computer Science I.  We had to make use of Java to create a game where you press a button to shoot at objects.  I went a bit above and beyond to create a game where the player can fly around and shoot objects.  You can probably tell that I was inspired by the Namaco game Galaga.  I added "Open Edition" to the title because the original used recolored Galaga sprites for the ships, and used a snipet of Dreamscaper's Miniature Fantasy as a loop for the Background Music.  I created new sprites in GIMP and created a Background Music loop with Fruit Loops Studio Mobile.

## Controls
You can use the buttons near the bottom of the screen to move your ship: the up arrow moves it up, the star button shoots, the left arrow for moving left, down arrow for moving down, right for moving right.  However, I recommend using the WASD or Arrow keys on the keyboard to move the ship, and using the spacebar to shoot.

## Tools Used
I originally created this using NetBeans 7.1, but I pushed the code here using Intellij Idea 2018.

## Credits
As you look through my code, you'll notice a block of names at the top of every source code file.

### Sam Lincoln
That's me!  I wrote the original version of this game.  I was also graded on this project for Computer Science I.  I'm also the one that decided to share this game to GitHub.

### Steve Sommer
He was my TA for the Computer Science I.  I'm pretty sure he might have helped me test the original project and squish some of the first bugs.  He was also in charge of handing out "cool points" for projects the TAs thought were cool.  I think I got a few points for the original version, but I don't know if my new sprites and BGM would make me lose those points.

### Mr. Ondrasek
He was my Computer Science I professor!  He taught how to use the Java Canvas to create animations, which we then used to create games like this one!  He also went in depth into how computers work internally, and how Java differs from other programming languages.  I really enjoyed his lectures!

## Known Bugs
- The Mute Music checkbox only stops the music from looping, it won't stop until the current loop is done.
